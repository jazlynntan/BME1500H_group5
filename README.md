This repository contains code for spike sorting and training a classification model for neuronal cell-typing in the subthalamic nucleus and globus pallidus from single neuron recordings in Parkinson's Disease.

1. Spike_sorting.ipynb to sort spikes and produce figures for manual curation
2. Model_training.ipynb:
  A. extract features
  B. prepare dataset
  C. train logistic regression, random forests, SVMs
  D. visualize model results
